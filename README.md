# Statistics and Probability
These are my notes for Statistics and Probabilty class of my highschool. I prepared these in a way so that anyone can use it to refresh their statistics and probability knowledge. But these are for people who are already somewhat familiar with the material, so it's better to not follow these as a text book. The first part is fairly introductory, but I will be creating notes on fairly advanced topics sooner or later.
